      "My recent consult was promptly scheduled and well-arranged. Dr Anderson is a caring and experienced professional. He tailored his exam to my medical history, foregoing what is now routine, a CT scan. He diagnosed my tooth status quickly (unlike 2 previous dentists). His office manager has organized patient/ doctor forms well with preparation serving both patient and office needs. This was an excellent experience for me.",

      "They are the best! I had an awful tooth infection that needed a root canal, I contacted their office and they were able to fit me in first thing in the morning the very next day. They answered any questions i had prior to the procedure and after the dr and his assistant made sure i was comfortable and had no discomfort during the whole procedure. They even went the extra mile to remove some of the plaque on my tooth and made sure I was very very numb so I wouldn't feel a thing! I would definitely recommend this office one of the best dentist visits I've had ever.",

      "Highly Recommend! Let's be honest, no one is ever thrilled about getting a root canal. But, Dr Anderson and his staff made it a breeze! In spite of having a stubborn tooth that needed extra time and attention, I felt completely comfortable and well taken care of. The office is very clean and up-to-date. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Dr. Anderson made sure the the treatment was painless and he took time to explain what was going on, and what to expect. If I ever need an endodontist again, this is where I'll be coming!",

      "From the first phone call to Dr. Anderson's office to days after my root canal, all I can describe is a wonderful experience. The staff was incredibly informative, kind, and friendly. The root canal itself was my third, and by far the easiest, fastest, and least painful. Dr Anderson personally calling me the following day after the procedure was an especially great personal touch that made me feel extremely cared about as a patient. As someone who has been living with Long Covid for over 3 years, I was also especially grateful to the office's commitment to clean, sanitized air. There were UV air filters in every room, including the bathroom. I pray I never need another root canal, but if I do, I know where I will be taking my business: Wine Country Root Canal / Dr Anderson's office!",

      'Wow!!! Going to an Endodontist for a root canal was something I wanted to avoid. Just thinking of the procedure raised my blood pressure. Dr. Anderson calmed me down and after a "few visits" to his office, I was ready to go. The procedure proved painless and easy to endure. Actually it was no big deal!!! A few hours now after the root canal and feeling no residual sensation. This Doctor is really good!!! A skilled, highly competent master of his craft. Shout out to his excellent team. Very efficient and professional staff. Hopefully will never need another root canal, but if I do it\'s back to Dr. Anderson.',
