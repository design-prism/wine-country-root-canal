                    I decided to become a dentist because I enjoy working with people, I love science and the results
                    are immediate and gratifying. I have been practicing dentistry since 1997. In 2003, I went back to
                    school to specialize in endodontics. I have been specializing solely in endodontics since 2005. This
                    practice is truly my life’s work and is the culmination of decades of hard work and a distinct
                    vision. It is a privilege to be practicing as an endodontist and I challenge myself every day to
                    improve my services and patient care any way I can.

                    Before becoming an endodontist, I attended University of Southern California for my undergraduate
                    education as well as for dental school. After graduation, I completed my General Practice Residency
                    at Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center. I practiced general dentistry for five years before
                    specializing in endodontics at University of Southern California.

                  <p>
                    I am always searching for better, higher quality endodontic treatments for my patients. I love
                    learning about new technologies and approaches to my work, and how these may benefit those who come
                    see me. I enjoy lecturing on endodontics to ensure emerging dentists have the most comprehensive
                    education.

                  <p>
                    I believe in having well-rounded knowledge of all aspects of dentistry, and not just an
                    understanding of root canals. To give you the best possible service and results, I am committed to continual education and learning. I attend dental lectures, meetings, and dental conventions to stay informed of new techniques, the latest products, and the newest equipment that a modern dental office can utilize to provide state-of-the-art dental care.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Being a member of various professional dental associations helps me stay abreast of the changes and recommendations for our profession. I have found that this comprehensive approach is of paramount importance when it comes to my patients' dental health, diagnoses, and treatment of complex cases.
